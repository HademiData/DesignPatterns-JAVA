    The example also shows how Builder produces products 
    of different kinds (car manual) using the same building steps.
    The Director controls the order of the construction. 
    It knows which building steps to call to produce 
    this or that car model. It works with builders only via their
     common interface. This allows passing different 
     types of builders to the director.

    The end result is retrieved from the builder object 
    because the director canâ€™t know the type of resulting product.
     Only the Builder object knows what does it build exactly.
